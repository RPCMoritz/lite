## Overview

This free version of Structurizr allows you to view/edit diagrams, view documentation, and view architecture decision records defined in a single DSL or JSON workspace.
Structurizr Lite can be used standalone for workspace viewing/authoring, or in conjunction with the cloud service/on-premises installation as an authoring/testing/staging environment.
